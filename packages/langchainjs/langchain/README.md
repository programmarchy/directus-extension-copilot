Looking for the Python version? Check out [LangChain](https://github.com/hwchase17/langchain).

**Production Support:** As you move your LangChains into production, we'd love to offer more hands-on support.
Fill out [this form](https://airtable.com/appwQzlErAS2qiP0L/shrGtGaVBVAz7NcV2) to share more about what you're building, and our team will get in touch.

## Quick Install

`yarn add langchain`

```typescript
import { OpenAI } from "langchain/llms/openai";
```

## Supported Environments

LangChain is written in TypeScript and can be used in:

- Node.js (ESM and CommonJS) - 18.x, 19.x, 20.x
- Cloudflare Workers
- Vercel / Next.js (Browser, Serverless and Edge functions)
- Supabase Edge Functions
- Browser
- Deno

## ü§î What is this?

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling
developers to build applications that they previously could not.
But using these LLMs in isolation is often not enough to
create a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge.

This library is aimed at assisting in the development of those types of applications.

## üìñ Full Documentation

For full documentation of prompts, chains, agents and more, please see [here](https://js.langchain.com/docs/).

## Relationship with Python LangChain

This is built to integrate as seamlessly as possible with the [LangChain Python package](https://github.com/hwchase17/langchain). Specifically, this means all objects (prompts, LLMs, chains, etc) are designed in a way where they can be serialized and shared between languages.

The [LangChainHub](https://github.com/hwchase17/langchain-hub) is a central place for the serialized versions of these prompts, chains, and agents.
