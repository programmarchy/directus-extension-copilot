# Chat models

Chat models are a variation on language models.
While chat models use language models under the hood, the interface they expose is a bit different.
Rather than expose a "text in, text out" API, they expose an interface where "chat messages" are the inputs and outputs.

Chat model APIs are fairly new, so we are still figuring out the correct abstractions.

The following sections of documentation are provided:

- **How-to guides**: Walkthroughs of core functionality, like streaming, creating chat prompts, etc.

- **Integrations**: How to use different chat model providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc).
