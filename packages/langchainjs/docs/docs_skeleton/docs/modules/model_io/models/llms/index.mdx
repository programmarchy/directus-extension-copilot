# LLMs

Large Language Models (LLMs) are a core component of LangChain.
LangChain does not serve its own LLMs, but rather provides a standard interface for interacting with many different LLMs.

For more detailed documentation check out our:

- **How-to guides**: Walkthroughs of core functionality, like streaming, async, etc.

- **Integrations**: How to use different LLM providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.)

## Get started

There are lots of LLM providers (OpenAI, Cohere, Hugging Face, etc) - the `LLM` class is designed to provide a standard interface for all of them.

In this walkthrough we'll work with an OpenAI LLM wrapper, although the functionalities highlighted are generic for all LLM types.
