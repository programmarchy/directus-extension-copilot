```typescript
let score = (1.0 - this.decayRate) ** hoursPassed + vectorRelevance;
```

`this.decayRate` is a configurable decimal number between 0 and 1. A lower number means that documents will be "remembered" for longer, while a higher number strongly weights more recently accessed documents.

Note that setting a decay rate of exactly 0 or 1 makes `hoursPassed` irrelevant and makes this retriever equivalent to a standard vector lookup.

## Usage

This example shows how to intialize a `TimeWeightedVectorStoreRetriever` with a vector store.
It is important to note that due to required metadata, all documents must be added to the backing vector store using the `addDocuments` method on the **retriever**, not the vector store itself.
