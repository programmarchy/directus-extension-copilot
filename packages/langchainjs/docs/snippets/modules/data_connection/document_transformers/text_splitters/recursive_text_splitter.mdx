Important parameters to know here are `chunkSize` and `chunkOverlap`. `chunkSize` controls the max size (in terms of number of characters) of the final documents. `chunkOverlap` specifies how much overlap there should be between chunks. This is often helpful to make sure that the text isn't split weirdly. In the example below we set these values to be small (for illustration purposes), but in practice they default to `1000` and `200` respectively.

```typescript
import { RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter } from "langchain/text_splitter";

const text = `Hi.\n\nI'm Harrison.\n\nHow? Are? You?\nOkay then f f f f.
This is a weird text to write, but gotta test the splittingggg some how.\n\n
Bye!\n\n-H.`;
const splitter = new RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter({
  chunkSize: 10,
  chunkOverlap: 1,
});

const output = await splitter.createDocuments([text]);
```

You'll note that in the above example we are splitting a raw text string and getting back a list of documents. We can also split documents directly.

```typescript
import { Document } from "langchain/document";
import { RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter } from "langchain/text_splitter";

const text = `Hi.\n\nI'm Harrison.\n\nHow? Are? You?\nOkay then f f f f.
This is a weird text to write, but gotta test the splittingggg some how.\n\n
Bye!\n\n-H.`;
const splitter = new RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter({
  chunkSize: 10,
  chunkOverlap: 1,
});

const docOutput = await splitter.splitDocuments([
  new Document({ pageContent: text }),
]);
```
