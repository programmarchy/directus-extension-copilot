```typescript
import { OpenAI } from "langchain/llms/openai";

const llm = new OpenAI({
  temperature: 0.9,
});
```

And now we can pass in text and get predictions!

```typescript
const result = await llm.predict("What would be a good company name for a company that makes colorful socks?");
// "Feetful of Fun"
```
