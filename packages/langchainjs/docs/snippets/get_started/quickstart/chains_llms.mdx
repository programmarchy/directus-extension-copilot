Using this we can replace

```typescript
const result = await llm.predict("What would be a good company name for a company that makes colorful socks?");
```

with

```typescript
import { OpenAI } from "langchain/llms/openai";
import { LLMChain } from "langchain/chains";
import { PromptTemplate } from "langchain/prompts";

const llm = new OpenAI({});
const prompt = PromptTemplate.fromTemplate("What is a good name for a company that makes {product}?");

const chain = new LLMChain({
  llm,
  prompt
});

// Run is a convenience method for chains with prompts that require one input and one output.
const result = await chain.run("colorful socks");
```
```typescript
"Feetful of Fun"
```
