# AutoGPT

AutoGPT is a custom agent that uses long-term memory along with a prompt designed for independent work (ie. without asking user input) to perform tasks.

## Isomorphic Example

import IsomorphicExample from "@examples/experimental/autogpt/weather_browser.ts";

In this example we use AutoGPT to predict the weather for a given location. This example is designed to run in all JS environments, including the browser.

<CodeBlock language="typescript">{IsomorphicExample}</CodeBlock>

## Node.js Example

import NodeExample from "@examples/experimental/autogpt/weather.ts";

In this example we use AutoGPT to predict the weather for a given location. This example is designed to run in Node.js, so it uses the local filesystem, and a Node-only vector store.

<CodeBlock language="typescript">{NodeExample}</CodeBlock>
