# Generative Agents

import GenerativeAgentsScript from "@examples/experimental/generative_agents/generative_agents.ts";

This script implements a generative agent based on the paper [Generative Agents: Interactive Simulacra of Human Behavior](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.03442) by Park, et. al.

In it, we leverage a time-weighted Memory object backed by a LangChain retriever.
The script below creates two instances of Generative Agents, Tommie and Eve, and runs a simulation of their interaction with their observations.
Tommie takes on the role of a person moving to a new town who is looking for a job, and Eve takes on the role of a career counselor.
