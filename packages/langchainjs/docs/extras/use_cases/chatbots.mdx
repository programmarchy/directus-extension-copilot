# Chatbots

Language models are good at producing text, which makes them ideal for creating chatbots.
Aside from the base prompts/LLMs, an important concept to know for Chatbots is `memory`.
Most chat based applications rely on remembering what happened in previous interactions, which `memory` is designed to help with.
