# Tabular Question Answering

Lots of data and information is stored in tabular data, whether it be csvs, excel sheets, or SQL tables.
This page covers all resources available in LangChain for working with data in this format.

## Chains

If you are just getting started, and you have relatively small/simple tabular data, you should get started with chains.
Chains are a sequence of predetermined steps, so they are good to get started with as they give you more control and let you
understand what is happening better.

## Agents

Agents are more complex, and involve multiple queries to the LLM to understand what to do.
The downside of agents are that you have less control. The upside is that they are more powerful,
which allows you to use them on larger databases and more complex schemas.
