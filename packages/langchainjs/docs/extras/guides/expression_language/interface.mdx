# Interface

In an effort to make it as easy as possible to create custom chains, we've implemented a ["Runnable"](/docs/api/schema_runnable/classes/Runnable) protocol that most components implement.
This is a standard interface with a few different methods, which make it easy to define custom chains as well as making it possible to invoke them in a standard way. The standard interface exposed includes:

- `stream`: stream back chunks of the response
- `invoke`: call the chain on an input
- `batch`: call the chain on a list of inputs

The type of the input varies by component. For a prompt it is an object, for a retriever it is a single string, for a model either a single string, a list of chat messages, or a PromptValue.

The output type also varies by component. For an LLM it is a string, for a ChatModel it's a ChatMessage, for a prompt it's a PromptValue, and for a retriever it's a list of documents.

You can combine runnables (and runnable-like objects such as functions and objects whose values are all functions) into sequences in two ways:

- Call the `.pipe` instance method, which takes another runnable-like as an argument
- Use the `RunnableSequence.from([])` static method with an array of runnable-likes, which will run in sequence when invoked

See below for examples of how this looks.
