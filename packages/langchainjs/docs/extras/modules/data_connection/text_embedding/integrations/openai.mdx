# OpenAI

The `OpenAIEmbeddings` class uses the OpenAI API to generate embeddings for a given text. By default it strips new line characters from the text, as recommended by OpenAI, but you can disable this by passing `stripNewLines: false` to the constructor.

```typescript
import { OpenAIEmbeddings } from "langchain/embeddings/openai";

const embeddings = new OpenAIEmbeddings({
  openAIApiKey: "YOUR-API-KEY", // In Node.js defaults to process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY
  batchSize: 512, // Default value if omitted is 512. Max is 2048
});
```

If you're part of an organization, you can set `process.env.OPENAI_ORGANIZATION` to your OpenAI organization id, or pass it in as `organization` when
initializing the model.
