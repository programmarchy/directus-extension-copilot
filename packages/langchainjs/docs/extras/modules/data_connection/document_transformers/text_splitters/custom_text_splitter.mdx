# Custom text splitters

If you want to implement your own custom Text Splitter, you only need to subclass TextSplitter and implement a single method: `splitText`. The method takes a string and returns a list of strings. The returned strings will be used as the chunks.

```typescript
abstract class TextSplitter {
  abstract splitText(text: string): Promise<string[]>;
}
```
