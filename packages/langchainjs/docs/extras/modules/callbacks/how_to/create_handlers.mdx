# Creating custom callback handlers

You can also create your own handler by implementing the `BaseCallbackHandler` interface. This is useful if you want to do something more complex than just logging to the console, eg. send the events to a logging service. As an example here is a simple implementation of a handler that logs to the console:

import CustomHandlerExample from "@examples/callbacks/custom_handler.ts";

<CodeBlock language="typescript">{CustomHandlerExample}</CodeBlock>

You could then use it as described in the [section](#built-in-handlers) above.
