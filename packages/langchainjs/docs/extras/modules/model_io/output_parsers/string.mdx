# String output parser

The `StringOutputParser` takes language model output (either an entire response or as a stream) and converts
it into a string. This is useful for standardizing chat model and LLM output.

This output parser can act as a transform stream and work with streamed response chunks from a model.

## Usage

import CodeBlock from "@theme/CodeBlock";
import StringExample from "@examples/prompts/string_output_parser.ts";

<CodeBlock language="typescript">{StringExample}</CodeBlock>
