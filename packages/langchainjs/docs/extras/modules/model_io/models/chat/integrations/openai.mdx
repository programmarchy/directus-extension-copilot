# ChatOpenAI

You can use OpenAI's chat models as follows:

import OpenAI from "@examples/models/chat/integration_openai.ts";

<CodeBlock language="typescript">{OpenAI}</CodeBlock>

If you're part of an organization, you can set `process.env.OPENAI_ORGANIZATION` with your OpenAI organization id, or pass it in as `organization` when
initializing the model.

## Calling fine-tuned models

You can call fine-tuned OpenAI models by passing in your corresponding `modelName` parameter.

This generally takes the form of `ft:{OPENAI_MODEL_NAME}:{ORG_NAME}::{MODEL_ID}`. For example:

import OpenAIFineTuned from "@examples/models/chat/integration_openai_fine_tune.ts";

<CodeBlock language="typescript">{OpenAIFineTuned}</CodeBlock>
