# AlephAlpha

LangChain.js supports AlephAlpha's Luminous family of models. You'll need to sign up for an API key [on their website](https://www.aleph-alpha.com/).

Here's an example:

import CodeBlock from "@theme/CodeBlock";
import AlephAlphaExample from "@examples/models/llm/aleph_alpha.ts";

<CodeBlock language="typescript">{AlephAlphaExample}</CodeBlock>
