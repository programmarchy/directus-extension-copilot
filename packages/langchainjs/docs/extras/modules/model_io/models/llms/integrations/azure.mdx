# Azure OpenAI

You can also use the `OpenAI` class to call OpenAI models hosted on Azure.

For example, if your Azure instance is hosted under `https://{MY_INSTANCE_NAME}.openai.azure.com/openai/deployments/{DEPLOYMENT_NAME}`, you
could initialize your instance like this:

```typescript
import { OpenAI } from "langchain/llms/openai";

const model = new OpenAI({
  temperature: 0.9,
  azureOpenAIApiKey: "YOUR-API-KEY",
  azureOpenAIApiVersion: "YOUR-API-VERSION",
  azureOpenAIApiInstanceName: "{MY_INSTANCE_NAME}",
  azureOpenAIApiDeploymentName: "{DEPLOYMENT_NAME}",
});
const res = await model.call(
  "What would be a good company name a company that makes colorful socks?"
);
console.log({ res });
```

If your instance is hosted under a domain other than the default `openai.azure.com`, you'll need to use the alternate `AZURE_OPENAI_BASE_PATH` environemnt variable.
For example, here's how you would connect to the domain `https://westeurope.api.microsoft.com/openai/deployments/{DEPLOYMENT_NAME}`:

```typescript
import { OpenAI } from "langchain/llms/openai";

const model = new OpenAI({
  temperature: 0.9,
  azureOpenAIApiKey: "YOUR-API-KEY",
  azureOpenAIApiVersion: "YOUR-API-VERSION",
  azureOpenAIApiDeploymentName: "{DEPLOYMENT_NAME}",
  azureOpenAIBasePath: "https://westeurope.api.microsoft.com/openai/deployments", // In Node.js defaults to process.env.AZURE_OPENAI_BASE_PATH
});
const res = await model.call(
  "What would be a good company name a company that makes colorful socks?"
);
console.log({ res });
```
