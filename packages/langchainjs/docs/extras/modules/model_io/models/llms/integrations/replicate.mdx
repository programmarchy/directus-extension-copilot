# Replicate

Here's an example of calling a Replicate model as an LLM:

```bash npm2yarn
npm install replicate
```

import ReplicateLlama2 from "@examples/models/llm/replicate_llama2.ts";

<CodeBlock language="typescript">{ReplicateLlama2}</CodeBlock>

You can run other models through Replicate by changing the `model` parameter.

You can find a full list of models on [Replicate's website](https://replicate.com/explore).
