# OpenAI

Here's how you can initialize an `OpenAI` LLM instance:

```typescript
import { OpenAI } from "langchain/llms/openai";

const model = new OpenAI({
  modelName: "text-davinci-003", // Defaults to "text-davinci-003" if no model provided.
  temperature: 0.9,
  openAIApiKey: "YOUR-API-KEY", // In Node.js defaults to process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY
});
const res = await model.call(
  "What would be a good company name a company that makes colorful socks?"
);
console.log({ res });
```

If you're part of an organization, you can set `process.env.OPENAI_ORGANIZATION` to your OpenAI organization id, or pass it in as `organization` when
initializing the model.
