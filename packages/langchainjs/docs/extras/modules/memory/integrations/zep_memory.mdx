# Zep Memory

[Zep](https://github.com/getzep/zep) is a memory server that stores, summarizes, embeds, indexes, and enriches conversational AI chat histories, autonomous agent histories, document Q&A histories and exposes them via simple, low-latency APIs.

Key Features:

- Long-term memory persistence, with access to historical messages irrespective of your summarization strategy.
- Auto-summarization of memory messages based on a configurable message window. A series of summaries are stored, providing flexibility for future summarization strategies.
- Vector search over memories, with messages automatically embedded on creation.
- Auto-token counting of memories and summaries, allowing finer-grained control over prompt assembly.
- [Python](https://github.com/getzep/zep-python) and [JavaScript](https://github.com/getzep/zep-js) SDKs.

## Setup

See the instructions from [Zep](https://github.com/getzep/zep) for running the server locally or through an automated hosting provider.
